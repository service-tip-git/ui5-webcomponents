          "description": "### Overview\n\nA layout component, representing a web page, consisting of a title, header with dynamic behavior, a content area, and an optional floating footer.\n\nThe component consist of several components:\n\n- `DynamicPageTitle` - a component, holding the title of the page, the navigation actions and the content. The displayed content changes based on the current mode of the `DynamicPageHeader`.\n- `DynamicPageHeader` - a generic container, which can contain a single layout component and any other HTML elements. The header works in two modes - expanded and snapped and its behavior can be adjusted with the help of different properties.\n- `Content area` - a generic container, which can have a single UI5 layout.\n- `Footer` - positioned at the bottom with a small offset and used for additional actions, the footer floats above the content.\n\n### Usage\n\nUse the `DynamicPage` if you need to have a title, that is always visible\nand a header, that has configurable Expanding/Snapping functionality.\nIf you don't need the Expanding/Snapping functionality it is better to use the\n`ui5-page` as a lighter component.\n\nThe app can add to the `default` slot of the ui5-dynamic-page either content that is designed to fit its container (e.g. has 100% height),\nor content with own height that may overflow its container. In the second case the `DynamicPage` will show a scrollbar that allows the user\nscroll through the content.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- Snapping of the `DynamicPageTitle` is not supported in the following case:\n - When the `DynamicPage` has a scroll bar, the component usually scrolls to the snapping point - the point, where the `DynamicPageHeader` is scrolled out completely. However, when there is a scroll bar, but not enough content to reach the snapping point, the snapping is not possible using scrolling.\n\n### Responsive Behavior\n\nDynamic page web component implements the responsive paddings design.\n\n### Keyboard Handling\n\n\n### Basic Navigation\n\n- [SPACE, ENTER, RETURN] - If focus is on a button inside DynamicPageTitle its action is being triggered, once activated.\nIf focus is on the snap header button (arrow button), or on the header itself, once activated, it triggers the associated action (such as snap/expand the header).\nIf focus is on pin button (the button with pin icon on the bottom of the header), once activated, it triggers the associated action (pinning of the header).\n\n### Fast Navigation\n- This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via `F6 / Shift + F6` or ` Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down /  Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up`.\nIn order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n\n- `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n\n### ES6 Module Import\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/DynamicPage.js\";`\n---\n\n\n### **Events:**\n - **pin-button-toggle** - Fired when the pin header button is toggled.\n- **title-toggle** - Fired when the expand/collapse area of the title is toggled.\n\n### **Slots:**\n - **default** - Defines the content of the Dynamic Page.\n- **titleArea** - Defines the title HTML Element.\n- **headerArea** - Defines the header HTML Element.\n- **footerArea** - Defines the footer HTML Element.\n\n### **CSS Parts:**\n - **content** - Used to style the content of the component\n- **fit-content** - Used to style the fit content container of the component.\n- **footer** - Used to style the footer of the component",

          "description": "### Overview\n\nThe DynamicSideContent (`ui5-dynamic-side-content`) is a layout component that allows additional content\nto be displayed in a way that flexibly adapts to different screen sizes. The side\ncontent appears in a container next to or directly below the main content\n(it doesn't overlay). When the side content is triggered, the main content becomes\nnarrower (if appearing side-by-side). The side content contains a separate scrollbar\nwhen appearing next to the main content.\n\n### Usage\n\n*When to use?*\n\nUse this component if you want to display relevant information that is not critical\nfor users to complete a task. Users should have access to all the key functions and\ncritical information in the app even if they do not see the side content. This is\nimportant because on smaller screen sizes it may be difficult to display the side\ncontent in a way that is easily accessible for the user.\n\n*When not to use?*\n\nDon't use it if you want to display navigation or critical information that prevents\nusers from completing a task when they have no access to the side content.\n\n### Responsive Behavior\n\nScreen width \\> 1440px\n\n- Main vs. side content ratio is 75 vs. 25 percent (with a minimum of 320px\neach).\n- If the application defines a trigger, the side content can be hidden.\n\nScreen width \\<\\= 1440px and \\> 1024px\n\n- Main vs. side content ratio is 66.666 vs. 33.333 percent (with a minimum of\n320px each). If the side content width falls below 320 px, it automatically slides\nunder the main content, unless the app development team specifies that it should\ndisappear.\n\nScreen width \\<\\= 1024px and \\> 720px\n\n- The side content ratio is fixed to 340px, and the main content takes the rest\nof the width. Only if the `sideContentFallDown` is set to `OnMinimumWidth`\nand screen width is \\<\\= 960px and \\> 720px the side content falls below the main content.\n\nScreen width \\<\\= 720px (for example on a mobile device)\n\n- In this case, the side content automatically disappears from the screen (unless\nspecified to stay under the content by setting of `sideContentVisibility`\nproperty to `AlwaysShow`) and can be triggered from a pre-set trigger\n(specified within the app). When the side content is triggered, it replaces the main\ncontent. We recommend that you always place the trigger for the side content in the\nsame location, such as in the app footer.\n\nA special case allows switching the comparison mode between the main and side content.\nIn this case, the screen is split into 50:50 percent for main vs. side content. The\nresponsive behavior of the equal split is the same as in the standard view - the\nside content disappears on screen widths of less than 720 px and can only be\nviewed by triggering it.\n\n### ES6 Module Import\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/DynamicSideContent.js\";`\n---\n\n\n### **Events:**\n - **layout-change** - Fires when the current breakpoint has been changed.\n\n### **Methods:**\n - **toggleContents(): _void_** - Toggles visibility of main and side contents on S screen size (mobile device).\n\n### **Slots:**\n - **default** - Defines the main content.\n- **sideContent** - Defines the side content.",

Consequently, when the user drags a column separator to resize the columns, the minimal allowed width of any resized column is 248px.\n\n### Keyboard Handling\n\n#### Basic Navigation\n\nWhen a column separator is focused,  the following keyboard\nshortcuts allow the user to resize the columns and change the layout:\n\n- [Shift] + [Left] or [Shift] + [Right] - Moves the separator to the left or right, which resizes the columns accordingly.\n- [Left] or [Right] - Moves the separator to the left or right with a bigger step, which resizes the columns accordingly.\n- [Home] - Moves the separator to the start position.\n- [End] - Moves the separator to the end position.\n- This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].\nIn order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n\n#### Fast Navigation\nThis component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].\nIn order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n\n### ES6 Module Import\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/FlexibleColumnLayout.js\";`\n---\n\n\n### **Events:**\n - **layout-change** - Fired when the layout changes via user interaction by dragging the separators\nor by changing the component size due to resizing.\n- **layout-configuration-change** - Fired when the `layoutsConfiguration` changes via user interaction by dragging the separators.\n\n### **Slots:**\n - **startColumn** - Defines the content in the start column.\n- **midColumn** - Defines the content in the middle column.\n- **endColumn** - Defines the content in the end column.",

Also they can be managed with\n`titleText` and `subtitleText` properties.\n\nTo display the desired illustration, use the `name` property, where you can find the list of all available illustrations.\n\n**Note:** By default the “BeforeSearch” illustration is loaded. To use other illustrations, make sure you import them in addition, for example:\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/illustrations/NoData.js\"`\n\n**Note:** Illustrations starting with the “Tnt” prefix are part of another illustration set. For example to use the “TntSuccess” illustration, add the following import::\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/illustrations/tnt/Success.js\"`\n\n### Structure\nThe IllustratedMessage consists of the following elements, which are displayed below each other in the following order:\n\n- Illustration\n- Title\n- Subtitle\n- Actions\n\n### Usage\n`ui5-illustrated-message` is meant to be used inside container component, for example a `ui5-card`,\na `ui5-dialog` or a `ui5-page`\n\n### ES6 Module Import\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/IllustratedMessage.js\";`\n---\n\n\n### **Slots:**\n - **title** - Defines the title of the component.\n\n**Note:** Using this slot, the default title text of illustration and the value of `title` property will be overwritten.\n- **subtitle** - Defines the subtitle of the component.\n\n**Note:** Using this slot, the default subtitle text of illustration and the value of `subtitleText` property will be overwritten.\n- **default** - Defines the component actions.\n\n**Note:** Not displayed when the `design` property is set to `Base`.\n\n### **CSS Parts:**\n - **subtitle** - Used to style the subtitle wrapper of the `ui5-illustrated-message`",

The use or non-use of icons must be consistent for all items on one level.\nYou must not combine entries with and without icons on the same level. We strongly recommend that you do not use icons on the second level.\n\nThe `ui5-side-navigation` component is designed to be used within a `ui5-navigation-layout` component to ensure an optimal user experience.\n\nUsing it standalone may not match the intended design and functionality.\nFor example, the side navigation may not exhibit the correct behavior on smaller screens.\nAdditionally, the padding of the `ui5-shellbar` will not match the padding of the side navigation.\n\n### Keyboard Handling\n\n### Fast Navigation\nThis component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].\nIn order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n\n\n### ES6 Module Import\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigation.js\"`\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationGroup.js\";` (for `ui5-side-navigation-group`)\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationItem.js\";` (for `ui5-side-navigation-item`)\n\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationSubItem.js\";` (for `ui5-side-navigation-sub-item`)\n---\n\n\n### **Events:**\n - **selection-change** - Fired when the selection has changed via user interaction\n\n### **Slots:**\n - **default** - Defines the main items of the component.\n- **fixedItems** - Defines the fixed items at the bottom of the component.\n\n**Note:** In order to achieve the best user experience, it is recommended that you keep the fixed items \"flat\" (do not pass sub-items)\n- **header** - Defines the header of the `ui5-side-navigation`.\n\n**Note:** The header is displayed when the component is expanded - the property `collapsed` is false;",

It can hold any type of HTML elements.\nIt's defined by using the `ui5-wizard-step` as slotted element within the `ui5-wizard`.\n\n### Scrolling\nThe component handles user scrolling by selecting the closest step, based on the current scroll position\nand scrolls to particular place, when the user clicks on the step within the navigation area.\n\n**Important:** In order the component's scrolling behaviour to work, it has to be limited from the outside parent element in terms of height.\nThe component or its parent has to be given percentage or absolute height. Otherwise, the component will be scrolled out with the entire page.\n\n**For example:**\n\n```html\n<ui5-dialog style=\"height: 80%\">\n\t<ui5-wizard></ui5-wizard>\n</ui5-dialog>\n```\n\n#### Moving to next step\nThe `ui5-wizard-step` provides the necessary API and it's up to the user of the component to use it to move to the next step.\nYou have to set its `selected` property (and remove the `disabled` one if set) to `true`.\nThe `ui5-wizard` will automatically scroll to the content of the newly selected step.\n\nThe Fiori 3 guidelines recommends having a \"nextStep\" button in the content area.\nYou can place a button, or any other type of element to trigger step change, inside the `ui5-wizard-step`,\nand show/hide it when certain fields are filled or user defined criteria is met.\n\n### Usage\n#### When to use:\nWhen the user has to accomplish a long or unfamiliar task.\n\n#### When not to use:\nWhen the task has less than 3 steps.\n\n### Responsive Behavior\nOn small widths the step's titleText, subtitleText and separators in the navigation area shrink and from particular point the steps are grouped together and overlap.\nTapping on them will show a popover to select the step to navigate to. On mobile device, the grouped steps are presented within a dialog.\n\n### ES6 Module Import\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/Wizard.js\";` (includes <ui5-wizard-step/>)\n---\n\n\n### **Events:**\n - **step-change** - Fired when the step is changed by user interaction - either with scrolling,\nor by clicking on the steps within the component header.\n\n### **Slots:**\n - **default** - Defines the steps.\n\n**Note:** Use the available `ui5-wizard-step` component.\n\n### **CSS Parts:**\n - **navigator** - Used to style the progress navigator of the `ui5-wizard`.\n- **step-content** - Used to style a `ui5-wizard-step` container.",
