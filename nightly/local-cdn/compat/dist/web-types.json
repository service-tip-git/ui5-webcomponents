          "description": "@deprecated Deprecated as of version 2.12.0, use `@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Table.js` instead.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe `ui5-table` component provides a set of sophisticated and convenient functions for responsive table design.\nIt provides a comprehensive set of features for displaying and dealing with vast amounts of data.\n\nTo render the `Table` properly, the order of the `columns` should match with the\norder of the item `cells` in the `rows`.\n\nDesktop and tablet devices are supported.\nOn tablets, special consideration should be given to the number of visible columns\nand rows due to the limited performance of some devices.\n\n### Selection\nTo benefit from the selection mechanism of `ui5-table` component, you can use the available selection modes:\n`SingleSelect` and `MultiSelect`.\n\nIn additition to the used mode, you can also specify the `ui5-table-row` type choosing between\n`Active` or `Inactive`.\n\nIn `SingleSelect` mode, you can select both an `Active` and `Inactive` row via mouse or\nby pressing the `Space` or `Enter` keys.\n\nIn `MultiSelect` mode, you can select both an `Active` and `Inactive` row by pressing the\n`Space` key when a row is on focus or via mouse click over the selection checkbox of the row.\nIn order to select all the available rows at once, you can use the selection checkbox presented in the table's header.\n\n**Note:** Currently, when a column is shown as a pop-in, the visual indication for selection is not presented over it.\n\n### Keyboard Handling\n\n#### Fast Navigation\nThis component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].\nIn order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n`import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n\nFurthermore, you can interact with `ui5-table` via the following keys.\n\n- [F7] - If focus is on an interactive control inside an item, moves focus to the corresponding item.\n- [Ctrl]+[A] - Selects all items, if MultiSelect mode is enabled.\n- [Home]/[End] - Focuses the first/last item.\n- [Page Up]/[Page Down] - Moves focus up/down by page size (20 items by default).\n- [Alt]+[Down]/[Up] - Switches focus between header, last focused item, and More button (if applies) in either direction.\n- [Shift]+[Down]/[Up] - Selects the next/previous item in a MultiSelect table, if the current item is selected (Range selection). Otherwise, deselects them (Range deselection).\n- [Shift]+[Home]/[End] - Range selection to the first/last item of the List.\n- [Ctrl]+[Home]/[End] - Same behavior as HOME & END.\n\n### ES6 Module Import\n\n- `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-compat/dist/Table.js\";`\n- `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-compat/dist/TableColumn.js\";` (`ui5-table-column`)\n- `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-compat/dist/TableRow.js\";` (`ui5-table-row`)\n- `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-compat/dist/TableGroupRow.js\";` (`ui5-table-group-row`)\n- `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-compat/dist/TableCell.js\";` (`ui5-table-cell`)\n---\n\n\n### **Events:**\n - **row-click** - Fired when a row in `Active` mode is clicked or `Enter` key is pressed.\n- **popin-change** - Fired when `ui5-table-column` is shown as a pop-in instead of hiding it.\n- **load-more** - Fired when the user presses the `More` button or scrolls to the table's end.\n\n**Note:** The event will be fired if `growing` is set to `Button` or `Scroll`.\n- **selection-change** - Fired when selection is changed by user interaction\nin `SingleSelect` and `MultiSelect` modes.\n\n### **Slots:**\n - **default** - Defines the component rows.\n\n**Note:** Use `ui5-table-row` for the intended design.\n- **columns** - Defines the configuration for the columns of the component.\n\n**Note:** Use `ui5-table-column` for the intended design.",
