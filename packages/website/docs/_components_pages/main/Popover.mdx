### Placement
You can influence the placement of the popup.
Note: if there is not enough space for the popup on the defined side, it will open on the side with enough space.

### Resizable
The Resizable sample demonstrates how the Popover component can be resized by dragging its edges.
This allows users to adjust the popup's width and height interactively, providing greater flexibility for content display.
